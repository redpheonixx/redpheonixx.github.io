April 8th, 2017 embark the start of the AIT Mozilla Community initiated by our alumnus, Abhijay Ghildiyal.
It marked the start of contibution to open source socities for many students and participants.
<br>
The meet was divided into 4 parts introduction to Mozilla  , localization of content ,informative talks on Rust language and webVR.
<br>
Representatives of the Mozilla community took to the platform to educate us on the foundations that make open-source contribution absolutely fascinating. Mozilla Pune representative, Prathamesh Chavan ( https://reps.mozilla.org/u/prathamesh/ ), took us back in time and made me respect Dennis Ritchie and Linus Torvalds for their contributions to the computing world. He told us interesting anecdotes of how open-source contribution had gained popularity after the development of Linux.
<br><br>
Next, we had Aniket Deshpande ( https://reps.mozilla.org/u/djaniketster/ )who urged us to get comfortable, sit down in a circle around him and acquainted us with his contribution to Mozilla. He talked about localisation of the web, which promotes inclusivity and ease of access of the web for all; overcoming language barriers by translating web pages and in-browser settings. He very modestly downplayed the way he and many other localisers have revolutionised the web by enabling people across generations, regions, nationalities and different abilities to access the web with ease.

Then, we had a webinar delivered by Vigneshwer Dhinakaran ( http://blog.mozillakerala.org/author/dvigneshwer/ ) on introduction to Rust systems programming language which was informative and well paced.
Despite a few technical glitches, ( I don’t know if webinars exist without technical glitches anyway(?) ) the session went on smoothly and we got to learn a lot. The undeniably cool aspect of Rust is that memory management while writing code isn’t the programmers responsibility. It lets the system do it for you! (Goodbye, segmentation fault). And that alone, made me want to jump onto the bandwagon. Learn more about Rust here:

The last speaker Tushar choudhary (3rd year student AIT) in his witty nature explained the very new WEB VR and A frame and how in the coming years the entire universe would be VR.The session ended with screening of a fun website made on A frame by me playing hindi parody of cheap thrills and snow falling on screen.Learn more about the project here:
